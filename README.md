# SPGetDataForJSDev

Refreshing client-side code that processes SharePoint data within a SharePoint page is slow. 
So the intention of this project is to enable local development using data copied from actual library calls to SharePoint.

Using React, I will create forms to call the PnP and SPScript SharePoint "helper" libraries and to expose the resulting data in a textarea.
